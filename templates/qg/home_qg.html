    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has developed computer tools to perform a number of tasks,
        Simulation of the intelligent way of solving problems by humans. Intelligence techniques have been identified
        Synthetics is also considered as one of the most valuable applications in the field of needs
        Didactic. The goal of these tools is to improve the way children interact with their environment to enhance learning and enrich their daily lives. It is the task of communicating information to the child in a manner
        Sound and interactive the most important challenges of the educational systems at the present time.
        In this project, we built an assistant system for the child, which relies on the principle of artificial intelligence in more than one place, such as selecting questions, forming a question, and generating an answer
        OK. The system is independent of the educational material, as it is possible to add new lessons so that the system automatically generates a set of different questions with the appropriate answers.

    <h5 class="bi-chat-dots title">  What are some applications of question generation?</h5>
    <p>In education, question generation helps in assessing reading comprehension. Students can use it for self-assessment. It can be used to create quizzes and online tests without manual effort from educators. By one estimate, teachers spend 50% of their time towards student assessments.

        Many versions of tests can be created to prevent cheating. For online courses and adaptive learning, these variations are helpful. A solution-oriented approach generates questions based on skills and concepts. A template-based approach uses variables, constraints and templates.

        For training question answering (QA) or dialogue systems, QG can produce question-answer pairs. Chatbots trained on QG can ask relevant questions in an ongoing dialogue.

        Often questions are generated from available answers. But it's possible to generate questions that seek more information or clarification. Such a model can be trained using conversational QA datasets.

        Applications also include help systems and multi-modal conversations involving virtual agents. One research applied QG for user authentication in online systems.
    </p>

    <h5 class="bi-chat-dots">  What are the different types of questions generated by QG systems?</h5>
    <p><span>Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)</span> are commonly generated for student assessments. Along with question, the correct answer and a few incorrect answers (called distractors) are generated. For English vocabulary assessment, QG systems could use WordNet, web searches and Word Sense Disambiguation.
    </p>
    <p><span>Fill-in-the-blank questions</span> are simpler than MCQs since there's no need to generate distractors. Fill-in-the-blank statements are first generated, from which questions are framed via NLP analysis.
    </p>
    <p><span>Wh-questions</span> are questions that ask "what, where, when, which, who, why" and "how". They could also include imperative statements that start with "name, tell, find, define or describe".

            <p class="lead">QG is quite unlike many NLP tasks. Whereas NLG generates sentences from some semantic input, the input to QG is often in natural language. Unlike machine translation, both input and output in QG are in the same language, and often there's no one-to-one correspondence. QG also significantly reorders and rephrases words.

        Whereas Question Answering (QA) is often extractive (selecting text spans from the input).In one example, a single sentence generated 2000+ questions. QG systems must therefore weed out silly questions from important ones.

        Often a generated question might require improvements to its grammar, form or simplicity. QG systems need to figure out long-distance dependencies to do this.

    <h5 class="bi-chat-dots">  What's a typical data pipeline in a question generation system?</h5>
    <p>QG systems can be classified based on the input type. The common ones are text-based QG, visual QG, and structured data-based QG. Structured QG uses knowledge graphs and semi-structured tables, where input is subject-object-relation triplet.

        QG pipelines might depend on the type of input, type of questions and the nature of the model. In general, we expect three steps:
    </p>
    <p> <span><li> Pre-processing:</li></span> Convert complex sentences into simpler ones, perhaps using parse trees. Using POS, dependency labels and SRL, classify sentences to determine type of question. Select content based on relevance to the final task. From web sources, mine and predict question patterns.
    </p>
    <p> <span><li>Question Construction:</li></span> Generate correct answers and distractors for MCQs. Select gap position for fill-in-the-blank questions. Transform assertive sentences into interrogative forms. Control the difficulty of questions.
    </p>
    <p> <span><li>Post-processing:</li></span> Construct the final surface form of questions. Rank questions to prioritize high-quality questions.
